## What is KYON?
KYON is a secure blockchain-based system which provides reliable drone flight data.

## Problems & Solutions
### Problems
- Drone industry grows bigger, and mid-sized and large-sized drones are being developed more than before. Larger-size drones have more safety issues accordingly. Yes, how do you feel if you cannot trust the drone pilot’s flight experience? A drone flying over your head may abruptly change into a deadly weapon. There are the accidents by the drones. What are the causes of those accidents? The aircraft itself? Less developed technology? Or government system? Most of all, it’s caused by human error, the “pilot”, just like manned aircrafts.
- The other one is about specialized drone operation skills in various industries. Drone industry has grown significantly so far, and now it requires not just “flying in the air” but “controlling to each industry need”. When you work in pest control, a professional drone operating skill specialized for pest control is needed. When you extinguish fire, it’s the same with the case. If a hired man has drone operating skills of just what a company needs, the company will reduce costs substantially. Is it available now? The answer is NO.

### Solutions
- The strongest tool against forgery so far is blockchain network. KYON project uses blockchain technology, too. Hold on a second. Everybody says, “I will upload the data onto blockchain and prevent forgery,” but what if the data already uploaded on the blockchain network is “already forged” or “wrong”? If so, it’ll be an even bigger problem. It cannot be amended. Verification process is necessary from the data collecting process, and the consequent data has to be stored in a secure network, blockchain. Accordingly, KYON has developed a data collecting device, FlightTracker® for accurate and secure data collecting. FlightTracker® is connected to a KYON application for user authentication. When the authentication finished, you stick it to a drone aircraft and collect flight information such as aircraft information, flight hours, altitude, and flight area. When flight ended, the “authenticated” and “personalized” data is stored in the blockchain network. Accurate data can be collected and stored this way. Now, “reliable” data comes from “reliable” network, so it will help us prevent drone accidents. Besides, correct and accurate flight experience data is uploaded on the blockchain, so the companies have no difficulties in recruiting the verified drone pilots.

- Flight data collected through FlightTracker® includes flight hours, flight areas, altitude, and SKYWORK-oriented flight skill grade as well as flight experience information. Anyone can easily view the information and evaluate which pilot is suitable for the job position. KYON’s affiliated drone academies will provide various classified flight missions. If someone completes a mission and passes the test, he will get a specialized flight skill. Companies will prefer the jobseeker than any others. Jobseeker will work for the company he wanted, and the company will reduce costs, and put him in a job immediately.

## KDMS(KYON Drone flight Management System) : How it works
In case of collecting safe and precise flight data, we need a hardware device, a personal authentication enabled, and a systematic network which connects the collected data with a smartphone terminal to upload onto the blockchain. The system is KDMS, KYON Drone flight Management System.
FlightTracker®, an adhesive device, collects flight data on an aircraft, connects a smartphone application, and upload the data onto the blockchain network. It’s a basic protocol of KDMS.

### - Step 1 |  Flight Data Gathering with FlightTracker®
The very beginning is gathering flight data from a drone aircraft which is flying in the air. FlightTracker® is based on an MCU board, which includes several sensors such as GPS and altimeter. It sticks to a drone aircraft and collects flight data.
(It does not communicate with the drone aircraft: there is no standard communication protocol among a lot of drone aerial vehicles. It independently collects flight data attached to the aircraft and saved the data in ROM.)

### - Step 2 |  Flight Data Store Between KYON Application & Blockchain Network
Collected flight data using FlightTracker® is transferred to KYON application, and uploaded to KYON blockchain network. When you transfer data into your smartphone application, you have to pass the user authentication process. KYON application synchronizes the user information and the user’s flight data. Each flight is subdivided into an individual process for management.
Use Case: service flow from flight data gathering to storage/query
